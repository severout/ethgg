/*
 *** Documentation and Example - Manual Threads configuration ***
 *
 * This config file is intended to be used with the -c parameter.
 *
 * Most people just don't need to manually configure the threads, so better
 * just run the miner with the --auto parameter and you're good.
 *
 * Otherwise, I first introduce the terms used here and in the logs:
 *   Thread : that's a software thread of execution in the program, when there
 *            are N, they're always numbered from 0 to N-1.
 *   CPU    : that's a processor in your computer, either logical or physical.
 *
 *
 * Each line of the array "cpu_threads_conf" below will be a concurrent thread
 * of execution. It contains at least three mandatory values:
 *
 * "cpu_architecture"    - You probably have no good reason to change it from
 *                         "auto" but you can use a specialized architecture
 *                         if you wish. Supported architectures are listed below.
 *                         Of course not every single architecture leads to a 
 *                         dedicated implementation, but a more specialized one
 *                         may hint a more specialized, and slightly faster,
 *                         implementation.
 *                         "generic" is the simplest implementation that works
 *                         with every possible SSE2-capable CPU in existence,
 *                         use it if you have a very exotic CPU (VIA...)
 *                         
 * "affine_to_cpu"       - Bind the thread to a CPU, which helps to avoid cache
 *                         misses. Otherwise use 'false' and let the OS manage
 *                         the selection of CPUs.
 *                         You can use an array of CPU numbers if you want the
 *                         thread to run on several CPUs at the same time.
 *                         e. g. "affine_to_cpu":[0,1,2,3]
 *                         
 * "use_cache"           - Use 'false' to disable all levels of CPU cache for a
 *                         thread and let the CPU work directly with the memory.
 *                         It usually implies a performance drop of 90%, so use
 *                         'false' only on computers which really need the CPU
 *                         caches for a more important task.
 *                         It can also be useful to make otherwise unused cores
 *                         mine to get a few extra hashes, typically for
 *                         Cryptonight-Heavy.
 *                         Ignored when "dual_mine_with" is present, since in
 *                         that case the cache is recycled from another thread,
 *                         see below.
 *                         
 * "dual_mine_with"      - (Optional)
 *                         Set a thread (not CPU!) index to grab some of its
 *                         cache and memory instead of allocating dedicated
 *                         ones. It helps in the (pretty rare) case of a CPU
 *                         with several cores but very low cache.
 *                         If thread X "dual_mine_with" thread Y, X will run
 *                         at ~25% speed and Y at ~90% speed, with X reusing
 *                         Y cache and memory while Y doesn't use them.
 *                         This happens when Y is busy doing heavy AES software
 *                         emulation with its registers, and that's why this
 *                         mode is not available with hardware AES.
 *                         This mode is also incompatible with Cryptonight-
 *                         Heavy, where it was observed always to lower hashrate.
 *                         
 * "multi_hash"          - (Optional)
 *                         Make a thread mine several hashes at the same time,
 *                         using multiple amounts of memory and cache.
 *                         This is useful for CPUs with a lot of cache like Xeon
 *                         or to mine with only a few Cores but all available
 *                         cache. This is the opposite concept of "dual_mine_with"
 *                         and both are of course mutually exclusive.
 *                         It also often gives a boost when mining Cryptolight
 *                         or IPBC.
 *                         Accepted values are false, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
 *                         (false and 1 both mean "no multi-hash"). Default is 1.
 *
 *
